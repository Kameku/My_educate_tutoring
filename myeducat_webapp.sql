He is good at recognizing phonemes yet he needs correction on his connection between sounds and phonograms. We will be working on this in our session and help him build a strong concept of sounds and phonograms(representatives of sound/written version of sounds). For example, he wrote cee for the word sea. c and s share one same sound s, ee and ea share one same sound ee. We will be learning all these and he would be able to recognize them eventually.</li><li>Reading. According to the Burt Word Reading Test we did, Arlo\'s reading age is between 6 and 7.

Did really well with WPR process, although could focus more on handwriting. AS tends to go quickly and rush her work, so most times prompting her to slow down will prevent errors. Intro of rule 2 and 3 took no time at all, Amelia picked it up and was able to articulate it super quickly. No problems with the sorting activities, and was fine with SD words. Some prompting needed i.e. using /g/ /j/ to make the sound /j/. Five minute snack break and free time on the iPad, then we restarted the lesson with a game of Cyclops and Giants. Again, Amelia was fine with the rules when she stopped and thought about it, and enjoyed the game. Used SD words in sentences. AS wrote one, then dictated the other five. Drew a picture to accompany. Tried to do ORF assessments, but it was hard to mark because Amelia would run her words together and mumble when she wasn’t sure, and this would snowball. As soon as she started mumbling/skimming over words, she’d lose her focus and wasn’t able to regain it without prompting.

Grammar and editing can come later). Identify that it\'s a great paragraph because it is several sentences about one idea, iron ore/Minecraft.</td></tr><tr><td>Introduce to informative and narrative text types using whiteboard sorters (Nate may be able/want to do this). Maybe only put up a couple of elements for informative (main idea, topic sentence… I can\'t think of what they are off the top of my head. Just enough so that he can identify last week\'s as an informative text), and for narrative just character, setting, plot. ID text type of last week\'s paragraph.</td></tr><tr><td>Explain that this week we\'re looking at Narratives. Narratives are fictional stories -- they\'re made up &amp; they need three elements. Read Fitzroy 24 and ID the characters, setting, story, and plot. 24 might be too easy for him, I can\'t think off the top of my head where he\'d be up to! If it is too easy, you can tell him that \"yes, this one\'s quite easy, but that\'s because we\'re trying to spot the elements, not practice your reading\" or something similar.</td></tr><tr><td>Explain to Nate that now we\'re going to write his own story. Brainstorm a character, a setting, and what the character is going to do. You might do this on the whiteboard.</td></tr><tr><td>Nate needs help with story writing. He\'s refusing to do it at school. My plan was to really heavily coach him in the creation of this story. You can refer back to 24 to demonstrate structure E.g.: First, we\'re going to write a sentence that introduces our character (highlight/point to first sentence of 24, telling us the character\'s name and that he\'s a cat). Second, tell me where the character is (point to \'Hawker went to the park\'). Third, introduce the plot by having something happen (point to \'he saw a dog\').</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Took us a while to get through phonos and SD, as Nate was very chatty and EC not good at redirecting!! Nate asked if we could do phonos 26-70, and was really good with all of them. Prompting needed with ey, ch sound order, gu, igh. Fine with WPR, pretty good with SD - some confusion between rules 5 and 6, did a few less words than planned. Looked at last week\'s paragraph - NB did a good job of editing his paragraph as he read (mostly in terms of Minecraft inaccuracies!). Able to articulate that \"a paragraph is a group of sentences about the same topic that are related and which go together\". Convo about INF/NAR text types, NB wasn\'t able to tell me anything about these and kept going off on tangents, so EC redirected and prompted responses. Used the three little pigs as a model for narrative text and orally talked through elements alongisde informative. NB able to ID his paragraph as an informative and tell me why (using elements). Planned a narrative text together, and Nate quickly wrote it up as a story with EC prompting. Just told Nate that we were writing a couple of sentences - asked him to write 1 introducing characters, 2 introducing setting, then a couple more giving the beginning, middle and end of the plot. Ended up being a story without him realising! Can use this as a springboard to do more advanced work later - we very much rushed through it. We ended up going 10mins over time because Nate just kept writing! He seemed very absorbed and I didn\'t want to stop him.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>', NULL, '2022-07-01 16:25:17', '2022-07-08 17:49:22'),

EC modelled all OPR phonos first, then LP was able to give sounds for them all and provide cues. Did WPR assessment on 1-30 and saw a massive improvement. Lewis was confident, engaged and focused on his work. He got all 30 phonos correct with minimal prompting (I helped with \'v\' and prompted \'k\' i.e. \"tall letter\"), and his handwriting was super accurate and neat. I praised him heaps and we looked at today\'s assessment alongside the ones from 2020 and 2021. Lewis was really happy and felt proud of himself! Finished the lesson by talking about syllables and introducing the 4x syllable types. LP initially struggled to ID the difference between open and closed sounds (esp. with confusion between letter names and sounds), but once he nailed this he was really onto it. Sorted a few syllable types together before we packed up. Will revisit on Thurs. Lewis and Alysia have been doing heaps of work at home with spelling and PA, and it sounds like its going really well for them.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>', '<figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Week Four, Lesson One</td></tr><tr><td>Monday, 15 August 2022</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>', '2022-08-15 08:50:06', '2022-09-14 16:37:05'),

He was really excited to tell me about a movie he\'d seen, so it took a while for him to settle into our activities initially. Once we did get into it, though, he worked really hard. Found PAST activity difficult, but persevered and was able to provide all correct responses with minimal prompting (some finger scaffolding provided). Did OPR with phonos 30-60, and while LP did need some help with cues, he was fine with sounds of pretty much all phonos. Really struggled with WPR assessment. LP didn\'t want to make a mistake, and really wanted to write the correct answer, so I helped him with most of the phonos. I noticed that he reversed a lot of letters, and used critical thinking to work out what some phonos were - e.g. if it \"can\'t go\", it must have an \'i\' or \'u\' at the end. I was impressed with his perseverance and rationalisation. He didn\'t get upset once, even though he struggled with pretty much all 30 of the phonos assessed today. This assessment didn\'t match the OPR one we did recently, where he was able to identify sounds for 41 of the 60 introduced phonos. This discrepancy fits with recent dyslexia diagnosis. LP struggles to recall written phonos to match the sounds (and letters in the right order), probably hence why his reading (decoding) is stronger than his spelling (encoding). Will continue to focus on this. Finished the last 10 minutes with a word dictation, and LP was suprisingly enthusiastic about this? He was excited to provide answers about syllables and sounds, and correct handwriting formation. We had a good discussion about rules 4 and 19 before doing our three words. Lewis was concerned about the accuracy and neatness of his writing, and fixed errors without prompting from me (e.g rubbing out an underline made in error). I was so impressed with him, and made sure that he grabbed a choccie at the end of the session.

Lewis sounded each given syllable, identified the final sound as consonant or vowel and then placed the magnet beneath the corresponding heading.

I encouraged Lewis to remain at the table during activities and that after each activity we could chat and he could leave the table. Only a couple of reminders were needed for him to settle which in turn supported his concentration.&nbsp; Lewis appeared eager to produce quality writing and articulately made many connections with concepts that he has been taught in the past.<br>&nbsp;<br>For Lewis’ next lesson, I would recommend repeating the Syllable Plus work today and perhaps adding in the c+le and the SFe syllable types.&nbsp; I notice he’s looked at SFe, so this might be another positive connection for him to make.&nbsp; I would also recommend returning to last lesson’s dictated words to identify syllable types.&nbsp; We didn’t get to do that but might be a useful segue from last lesson to next.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>', '<figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Week Five, Lesson Two</td></tr><tr><td>Thursday, 25 August 2022</td></tr><tr><td>NW relief</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>', '2022-08-25 08:53:03', '2022-09-17 16:24:25'),

Connor wasn’t as bad once I asked him to focus on his handwriting, but the size of his letters can sometimes be far too big. Lachlan was working really slowly and seemed disengaged – wasn’t bothering to try and answer my questions, possibly because he knew Connor would answer quickly. Finished SD words and asked the boys to do a sentence writing task. Lachlan was resistant and needed lots of prompting. Connor was eager to get going but gave me a sentence using ‘judge’ as a noun to start with. He tweaked it slightly and was able to self-correct his error when he realised.

Discussed homophones (Lachlan unable to tell me what the word meant straight away and needed prompts), then I asked Lachlan to use them both in sentences. He was fine with ‘weather’, although I did ask him to improve it by adding more information. He was a bit stumped on ‘whether’ though. It seems that he didn’t really understand the word, and it seemed to frustrate him.

We were in T1 which was different to normal, he\'d just recovered from being sick, and he\'d had his meds later than usual - all of these things contributed, I think. As a result, I definitely needed to give him more prompts to sit down, listen or focus, but we still got through everything I wanted to. Wandered around during PA and MA, but still got everything right. Needed some coaching with manipulating words in Donah part 1, but probably due to lack of focus. I was so impressed with Lewis\' handwriting in particular today. It seemed to be happening for him without requiring too much concentration on his end - more of a habit for him now. I corrected his formation of \'y\' once (wrote it as it\'s typed), and he continued to write it correctly for the rest of the lesson without my prompt. Got through PA, MA, phonos in 15mins! No issue IDing markings in SD words, and we got through them pretty efficiently. Pretty much finished spelling by 9:05 (20mins). Lewis had a two minute drawing break, and as soon as I told him time was up, he put it to the side with no complaint. We spent the last portion of our lesson building a sentence using Lewis\' spelling words. Verbally, he came up with \"The boy looked at books\", and I suggested adding the spelling word \'six\'. I wrote on the board: \"The boy looked at six books\", and then progressively asked Lewis to add a word to describe the boy, to describe the books, and then to describe how he looked (i.e adjectives &amp; adverb). Final sentence: \"The speedy boy looked happily at six dragon-tail books\". Lewis wrote this into his book with great care and precision (beautiful handwriting), then underlined his spelling words. To finish, I analysed the sentence with Lewis, asking him to ID the subject (\"who the sentence is about\") and the verb first, then looking at the various describing words. Lewis has been doing this at school, even using the language of noun and verb, but he wasn\'t able to articulate this knowledge with me.

E.g. when marking the PoS in sentences, both boys were fine working independently.

It was difficult to keep him on task, however when he did so he very quickly picked up the concept of “2 o’clock” and instructing his pencil. I was impressed by his ability and so tried to move him away from the scaffold to the 2x2 boxes, but although he retained the 2 o’clock start when tracing the letter, he abandoned it immediately when copying.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the lesson I spoke with Anne about how James had gone. She seemed keen on the clockface letters (“Great, great, I’m an early childhood educator so I understand what you’re saying”), and then asked how James was going with his name. It was here that she started to get aggressive. In summary, she said:</p><ul><li>James can’t write his name.</li><li>She wants him to be able to write his name. This was “the one thing [she] asked for” in regard to tutoring.</li><li>Writing his own name is a milestone measured at school. He needs to be able to write his name (she was very insistent on this point).</li><li>She thought after 8-9 weeks of tutoring he would have improved, but he hasn’t got any better. She re-iterated this point a lot as well.</li><li>I explained my mentality on teaching the letters in groups. I briefly explained that I would rather teach them in formation based groups rather than in the context of his name, and then once he can write all the letters he’ll obviously be able to write his own name, as one skill follows the other. James knows which letters go in his name and which order they go in. Anne said she didn’t understand what I was saying here.</li><li>The conversation was a difficult one also because James was yelling at both of us in excitement.</li></ul><p>Below email to Mum sent 20.9.20 in response to conversation:</p><p>Dear Anne,</p><p>I hope you’ve had a wonderful rest of your day. I just wanted to follow on from our conversation this morning, as I feel like my ‘off the top of my head’ explanation of what I’m hoping to achieve with James could have been worded much more effectively!</p><p>Essentially, I want to consolidate James’ knowledge of letters and letter writing by looking at them in groups based on handwriting formation (such as a, c, d, g, o, s, and q, which all begin at the same point). Doing so helps to reinforce the neural pathways required to write those letters, and forms mental connections that don’t necessarily occur when learning to write letters in an individual, isolated context. Alongside being best practice teaching, I feel that this will be especially helpful for James given that his fine motor skills are still developing. If you’re interested, I’ve attached an excerpt from the Independent Kids Handwriting Program to illustrate what I mean by handwriting formation groups! We use a slightly modified version here, but the principle is the same.</p><p>I’m also using explicit instruction during handwriting and having James articulate his understanding back to me. We’re doing lots of ‘talking to our pencil’, and will be recognising short/tall letters, letters that extend below the base line (I like to call them monkey letters, because they have a monkey tail ), as well as other handwriting features such as the base line, midpoint, and top line. I feel really strongly about getting these concepts down early, since they’re so foundational and will be built on when spelling/writing words and sentences becomes a focus.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of writing his name, James did write it independently on the board this morning! I’ve attached a photo for you. As you can see, his formation for ‘a’ and ‘m’ needs development – we’ve been working on ‘a’ (as part of the clockface letters) for the last two weeks, but as I mentioned to you this morning, James isn’t quite ready to apply the correct formation without a scaffold just yet. If you imagine the ‘a’ as being written over a clock, James currently starts writing the letter at 10 o’clock, which means his pencil isn’t in the right position to draw the line down the side. Another general formation element to keep an eye on will be him lifting his pencil from the paper, and a good one to keep reinforcing at home as well. It’s also great that I’m not seeing any reversals in his writing, and although his ‘e’ could be written more accurately, that it begins and ends in the correct place is a sound start.</p><p>It sounds as though you’re already working with James at home. Would you be open to me sending home some activities and scaffolds to use, so that James is receiving consistent instruction and hearing the same language? I’ve got a great name writing activity to do with James next week, and I’m happy to provide you with a copy to do at home as well if that’s of interest to you!</p><p>Please let me know if you’d like to chat further about anything I’ve mentioned here, and please feel welcome to share your thoughts.</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Neve.</p>', NULL, '2022-09-20 17:12:21', '2022-09-20 17:18:14'),

Normally Lewis understands when it\'s time to stop chatting or moving and start working, but today he really didn\'t settle easily into the work. Really good with SD esp once we got into the groove. After SD LP wanted to draw and he\'d done really well with SD so I gave him a couple minutes of drawing time while I prepared the next task. I then asked him to read given sentences (well within his scope of decoding), ID the subject noun, action verb, then the spelling words I\'d used. For some reason Lewis was REALLY resistant to reading the sentences, and fully refused, saying \"no. I\'m not going to read it ever\". He also didn\'t want to read a reader instead, or handwrite sentences, despite my reasoning with him and explaining that they were easy. Eventually he decided that he would read the sentences if I \"did the circling\", and we got through two sentences (easily).

Able to construct interesting and accurate sentences using spelling words and demonstrating their meaning. Able to ID elements of narrative texts and discuss in relation to narrative ORF, but then really struggled to articulate writing process steps and needed lots of prompting with these. I was so impressed with James\' creativity and how much it\'s improved since the last narrative we wrote. He created a plan for the second instalment of Bob &amp; Jeff\'s adventures, and almost seemed to enjoy coming up with different scenarios and antics.
